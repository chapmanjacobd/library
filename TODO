- speed up queries:

1. do joins in python (this is kinda sketchy for the DBA in me but I think it will ultimately be good. SQLite only uses one index per query so I will have more ability to control which indexes get used per subquery.)
2. use postgres? but I kinda hate the portability aspect--but maybe it isn't so bad
