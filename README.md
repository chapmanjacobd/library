# lb: xk media library

A wise philosopher once told me, "[The future is autotainment](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F9sZFrsjPp0)".

Manage large media libraries. Think Plex but minimalist and CLI-only. Primary usage is local filesystem but also supports some virtual constructs like tracking video playlists (eg. YouTube subscriptions) and browser tabs.

Requires `ffmpeg`

## Install

    pip install xklb

## Quick Start -- filesystem

### 1. Extract Metadata

For thirty terabytes of video the initial scan takes about four hours to complete. After that, rescans of the same path (or any subpaths) are much quicker--only new files will be read by `ffprobe`.

    lb extract tv.db ./video/folder/

![termtosvg](./examples/extract.svg)

### 2. Watch / Listen from local files

    wt tv.db                          # the default post-action is to do nothing after playing
    wt tv.db --post-action delete     # delete file after playing
    lt finalists.db --post-action=ask # ask to delete after playing

## Quick Start -- tube (track online video playlists)

### 1. Download Metadata

Download playlist and channel metadata. Break free of the YouTube algo~

    lb tubeadd educational.db https://www.youtube.com/c/BranchEducation/videos

[![termtosvg](./examples/tubeadd.svg "lb tubeadd example")](https://asciinema.org/a/BzplqNj9sCERH3A80GVvwsTTT)

You can add more than one at a time.

    lb tubeadd maker.db https://www.youtube.com/c/CuriousMarc/videos https://www.youtube.com/c/element14presents/videos/ https://www.youtube.com/c/DIYPerks/videos

![termtosvg](./examples/tubeadd_multi.svg)

And you can always add more later--even from different websites.

    lb tubeadd maker.db https://vimeo.com/terburg

To prevent mistakes the default configuration is to download metadata for only the newest 20,000 videos per playlist/channel.

    lb tubeadd maker.db --yt-dlp-config playlistend=1000

Be aware that there are some YouTube Channels which have many items--for example the TEDx channel has about 180,000 videos. Some channels even have upwards of two million videos. More than you could likely watch in one sitting. On a high-speed connection (>500 Mbps), it can take up to five hours just to download the metadata for 180,000 videos. My advice: start with the 20,000.

#### 1a. Get new videos for saved playlists

Tubeupdate will go through all added playlists and fetch metadata of any new videos not previously seen.

    lb tubeupdate

### 2. Watch / Listen from websites

    lb tubewatch maker.db

If you like this I also have a [web version](https://unli.xyz/eject/)--but this Python version has more features and it can handle a lot more data.

## Quick Start -- tabs (visit websites on a schedule)

tabs provides a way to organize your visits to URLs that you want to visit every once in a while.

If you want to track _changes_ to websites over time there are better tools out there, like
`huginn`, `urlwatch`, or `changedetection.io`.

The use-case of tabs are websites that you know are going to change: subreddits, games, or tools that you want to use for a few minutes every certain frequency (eg. daily/weekly/monthly/quarterly/yearly).

### 1. Add your websites

    lb tabsadd --frequency monthly --category fun https://old.reddit.com/r/Showerthoughts/top/?sort=top&t=month https://old.reddit.com/r/RedditDayOf/top/?sort=top&t=month

Depending on your shell you may need to quote the URLs.

If you use Fish shell know that you can enable features to make pasting easier:

    set -U fish_features stderr-nocaret qmark-noglob regex-easyesc ampersand-nobg-in-token

Also I recommend turning Ctrl+Backspace into a super-backspace for repeating similar commands with different long URLs:

    echo 'bind \b backward-kill-bigword' >> ~/.config/fish/config.fish

If you have an existing line-deliminated file you can import it like this:

    lb tabsadd -f monthly -c reddit ~/lb/tabs.db (cat ~/mc/reddit.monthly.cron)

### 2. Add lb tabs to cron

lb tabs is meant to run **once per day**. Here is how you would configure it with `crontab`:

    45 9 * * * DISPLAY=:0 lb tabs /home/my/tabs.db

If things aren't working you can use `at` to simulate a similar environment as `cron`

    echo 'DISPLAY=:0 lb tabs /full/path/to/tabs.db' | at NOW

You can also invoke tabs manually:

    lb tabs -L 1  # open one tab

## Things to know

When the database file path is not specified, `video.db` will be created / used.

    lb extract ./tv/

The same for audio: `audio.db` will be created / used.

    lb extract --audio ./music/

Likewise, `fs.db` from:

    lb extract --filesystem /any/path/

If you want to specify more than one directory you need to mention the db file explicitly.

    lb extract --filesystem one/
    lb extract --filesystem fs.db one/ two/

Organize via separate databases.

    lb extract --audio both.db ./audiobooks/ ./podcasts/
    lb extract --audio audiobooks.db ./audiobooks/
    lb extract --audio podcasts.db ./podcasts/ ./another/more/secret/podcasts_folder/

## Usage

### Repeat

    lt                  # listen to 120 random songs (DEFAULT_PLAY_QUEUE)
    lt --limit 5        # listen to FIVE songs
    lt -l inf -u random # listen to random songs indefinitely
    lt -s infinite      # listen to songs from the band infinite

### Watch longest videos

    wt tv.db --sort duration desc

### Watch specific video series in order

    wt tv.db --search 'title of series' --play-in-order

There are multiple strictness levels of --play-in-order. If things aren't playing in order try adding more `O`s

    wt tv.db --search 'title of series' -O    # default
    wt tv.db --search 'title of series' -OO   # slower, more complex algorithm
    wt tv.db --search 'title of series' -OOO  # most strict

### See how many corrupt videos you have

    lb wt -w 'duration is null' -p a

### Listen to OSTs on chromecast groups

    lt -cast -cast-to 'Office pair' -s '  ost'

### Exercise and watch TV that doesn't have subtitles

    wt -u priority -w subtitle_count=0

### Print a list of files below a 1280px resolution

    wt -w 'width<1280' -p f

### Play files under a certain throughput

Bitrate information is not explicitly saved but you can use file size and duration as a proxy:

    wt -w 'size/duration<50000'

### Check if you've downloaded something before

    wt -u duration --print -s 'video title'

### View how much time you have listened to music

    lb lt -w play_count'>'0 -p a

### See how much video you have

    lb wt video.db -p a

### Frequency

    -f daily
    -f weekly (spaced evenly throughout the week if less than 7 tabs in the category)
    -f monthly (spaced evenly throughout the month if less than 30 tabs in the category)
    -f quarterly (spaced evenly throughout 3 months if less than 90 tabs in the category)
    -f yearly (spaced evenly throughout the year if less than 365 tabs in the category)

ie. if 14 tabs, two URLs are opened per day of the week

### You can pipe stuff
